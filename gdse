Great â€” here's how to **remove the hardcoded `SAMPLE_SPENDING_DATA`** and **replace it with your live backend data** using the `transactions` state you're already managing.

---

### ðŸ§¨ What to Remove

Currently, you're doing something like this (based on your screenshots):

```tsx
const SAMPLE_SPENDING_DATA = {
  "2025-06-01": {
    total: 140.5,
    transactions: [
      { category: "Rent", amount: 50.0, description: "Monthly rent" },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
};

const getSpendingData = (day: number) => {
  const key = `${year}-${String(month + 1).padStart(2, "0")}-${String(day).padStart(2, "0")}`;
  return SAMPLE_SPENDING_DATA[key] ?? { total: 0, transactions: [] };
};
```

---

### âœ… Replace with a Live `getSpendingData` Function

Assuming you're already fetching transactions into:

```tsx
const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState<Transaction[]>([]);
```

Hereâ€™s what to do instead:

---

### âœ… Step 1: Delete `SAMPLE_SPENDING_DATA`

Just delete:

```tsx
const SAMPLE_SPENDING_DATA = { ... };
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Replace `getSpendingData` with this:

```tsx
const getSpendingData = (day: number) => {
  const dateKey = `${year}-${String(month + 1).padStart(2, "0")}-${String(day).padStart(2, "0")}`;
  const dailyTransactions = transactions.filter(t => t.date === dateKey);
  const total = dailyTransactions.reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0);
  return {
    total,
    transactions: dailyTransactions
  };
};
```

> âœ… This uses the real `transactions` state and computes daily totals and matching transactions for each day.

---

### âœ… Step 3: Use This Instead of `SAMPLE_SPENDING_DATA[...]`

Anywhere you were doing something like:

```tsx
const currentMonthData = SAMPLE_SPENDING_DATA[...];
```

Replace with a call to `getSpendingData(day)` like:

```tsx
const spendingData = getSpendingData(day);
```

Youâ€™ve already done this in your code like:

```tsx
const selectedDayData = selectedDay ? getSpendingData(selectedDay) : null;
```

Keep doing that â€” just make sure itâ€™s not pulling from `SAMPLE_SPENDING_DATA`.

---

### âœ… Step 4: Confirm Date Format Consistency

Make sure:

* Backend returns dates like `"2025-06-01"`
* You match that format in `getSpendingData`

---

### âœ… Final Reminder

After doing this:

* Your calendar will reflect **real backend data**
* Adding a transaction will `setTransactions([...prev, newTx])` and your totals/cards will update instantly

Let me know if you want me to double-check any of those replacement lines you use for mapping days, rendering badges, or dialog summaries.
