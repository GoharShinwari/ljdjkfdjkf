Yes — ✅ **your server absolutely needs to be running** for this to work. Here's why:

### 🔧 Why You Need the Server Running

Your frontend is trying to:

* `POST` to `/api/me/transactions/`
* `GET` from `/api/me/transactions/`

These are **backend endpoints** defined in your FastAPI server (as shown in your screenshot). If the server isn’t running, those requests will fail with:

```
Network Error
Failed to fetch
404 Not Found
```

---

### ✅ To make it work:

1. **Run your FastAPI server** (usually):

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   Or however your project is set up (`main.py`, `app.py`, etc.).

2. Make sure it’s running on the correct port — often `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3. If your frontend is on another port (like Vite on `3000`), you may need to:

   * **Proxy requests** using a Vite config.
   * Or hit `http://localhost:8000/api/...` in your fetch calls explicitly.

---

### ✅ Pro Tip (for local testing)

If you're testing with mock data or fake user `99`, you can:

* Temporarily bypass auth in the backend (not recommended in production).
* Or log in to get a valid session token and let the backend handle it properly (ideal).

---

### 🔁 TL;DR

* Yes, **you need the FastAPI backend running**.
* Make sure ports and CORS are handled properly if frontend and backend are separate.
* Let me know if you want help setting up a dev proxy or testing locally!
