Yes — based on how everything's wired now, **when you click “Add Transaction”**, it will:

### ✅ Do the following:

1. **Open prompt dialogs** (category, description, amount)
2. Send a `POST` to your backend at `/users/me/transactions/`
3. ✅ Save the transaction to your database
4. ✅ Update the `spendingData` state in your context
5. ✅ Instantly re-render:

   * 📆 The calendar day will show a new amount and “x transactions”
   * 🧾 The modal will list the new transaction in a styled box

---

### ✨ And visually:

* The **calendar cell** will now show:

  * `"₹xx.xx"` in color
  * `x transactions`
  * 🟨🟧🟩 background if you use conditional styling (optional, but you seem to have it!)
* The **modal** will display:

  * The new transaction with **category**, **amount**, **description**
  * Plus “Edit” and “Delete” buttons styled cleanly

---

### 💡 Want that soft green/yellow/red coloring per amount?

Update your day cell styling like this:

```tsx
const bgColor =
  dayData.total > 700
    ? "bg-red-100 text-red-800"
    : dayData.total > 300
    ? "bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800"
    : "bg-green-100 text-green-800";
```

Then apply it:

```tsx
<p className={`text-sm font-semibold px-1 rounded ${bgColor}`}>
  ₹{dayData.total.toFixed(2)}
</p>
```

---

If you want:

* a proper **form modal** instead of `prompt()`
* live **delete/edit** that talks to the backend
* per-day **budget coloring**
* or saving category preferences

Just say the word. You're now in full control. 💼💰
